## 👋 About Me

Engineering leader, builder, and lifelong learner with 12+ years at LinkedIn (and startups), passionate about creating products that delight users and make an impact. I've scaled teams, architected large-scale systems, and launched features used by millions—including LinkedIn's first Swift app, SEO infrastructure for an Alexa Top 100 site, and AI-driven solutions for enterprise clients.

I thrive on solving challenges at the intersection of AI, infrastructure, and product. Currently, I'm deepening my engineering expertise and exploring AI science and infra. Whether building distributed systems, optimizing performance, or mentoring engineers and managers, I love rolling up my sleeves and driving results.

Curiosity fuels me: I'm pursuing a BS in CS, planning an MS in Robotics, and always tinkering—be it Vision OS projects, IoT ideas, startup products, or new tech for fun. I enjoy sharing knowledge, helping others break into tech, and connecting over engineering, AI, robotics, or any of my hobbies (fishing, diving, kayaking, martial arts, gaming). _Let's connect!_
